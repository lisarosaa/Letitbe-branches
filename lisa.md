# Hello Everyone

My name is **Lisa Rosanty**, you can call me **Lisa**.

I come from Indonesia :Indonesia: and I have lived in Belgium for almost 1,5 years while studying Sustainable Development at KU Leuven.

I would like to use my programming skills for addressing urban problems or solving sustainable issues (because it is my background academic)

My favorite quote:
>“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” – Mark Twain
